","Okay, here's the simplified explanation of that legal text:  **Simplified Explanation:**  Basically, if you (the client) want to end this agreement *before* the agreed-upon end date, you'll have to pay a $200 fee.  You also *have* to tell the other party you're quitting at least 30 days beforehand, and in writing (like a letter or email). If you don't give them that 30-day written notice, they might charge you more money or even sue you.","High","Okay, here's the plain English breakdown:

*   **If you end this agreement early, you'll have to pay a $200 fee.**
